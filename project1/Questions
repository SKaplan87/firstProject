How do I attach animation from events
  power/accuracy bars
  ball/goalie move
    do i make a different id and animation for each?
    can i just attach the ball to each div and have it animate to that location

How do I organize all this.
  one page with function definitions, one with function calls?
  wrap everything up in one function to create rounds
  wrap all of that up in one function to create different games
