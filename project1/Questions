How do I attach animation from events
  power/accuracy bars
    why is it moving in the wrong direction a little first?
  ball/goalie move
    do i make a different id and animation for each?
    can i just attach the ball to each div and have it animate to that location

How do I organize all this.
  one page with function definitions, one with function calls?
  wrap everything up in one function to create rounds
  keep code safe while testing other code


Is there a downside to creating the structure in the html page rather than the js page?

did I give credit where i borrowed logic from adequately?
